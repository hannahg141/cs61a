* cmd+s : saves the current file* cmd+x : cuts the entire line your cursor is on* cmd+v : pastes the entire line you cut in the line above your cursor OR pastes the selected text in place* cmd+z : undo* cmd+y : redo* cmd+[ : indent a line or a group of lines* cmd+] : dedent a line or a group of lines* cmd+d (my favorite!): highlights the current word. For every 'cmd+d' you type after this first word, it will highlight every next instance of the word. This allows you to easily rename variables with multiple cursors! (Play around with this one, it's fun!)* cmd+tab : moves you to the next tab* cmd+shift+tab : moves you to the previous tab* cmd+f : search for a word* cmd+shift+f : searches through all tabs* cmd+shift+p : This one's important. This opens up a little panel of tools! You can do things like type "ss python" which will set the syntax of your file to python or "reindent" will help you reindent a file you paste in (this will be helpful in future labs!)
